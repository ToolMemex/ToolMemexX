You are tasked to elevate a React 18+ application to a premium, production-grade product with flawless UX, performance, accessibility, and SEO readiness. Implement the following deliverables precisely:

---

1. **Global Dark Mode Context System:**
   - Create a `ThemeProvider` using React Context API.
   - Automatically detect system theme (`matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')`).
   - Persist user preference in `localStorage` with fallback.
   - Apply `dark` class to `<html>` or `<body>`, enabling Tailwind's dark mode utilities.
   - Animate theme transitions smoothly using TailwindCSS `transition-colors transition-background`.

2. **Editable, Optimistic Profile Form:**
   - Build a modular, validated form using `react-hook-form`.
   - Fields:
     - `Name`: Required text input.
     - `Email`: Required input with strict email validation.
     - `Profile Picture`: Image upload with instant preview (FileReader API).
   - Optimistically update UI upon submission.
   - Convert uploaded images to WebP format before preview/save.
   - Display skeleton loaders, error boundaries, and toast notifications (success/error).

3. **Dynamic SEO with react-helmet-async:**
   - Integrate `react-helmet-async` across the app with `<HelmetProvider>`.
   - On Profile page, inject Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags:
     - Title: Dynamic based on user name.
     - Description: Personalized.
     - Image: Profile image URL fallback.
     - URL: Dynamic page URL.
   - Setup default meta data in case of missing fields.
   - Optional: Implement JSON-LD structured schema for profiles.

4. **Engineering Requirements:**
   - Modularize theme logic into a `useTheme` custom hook.
   - Create a `useSEO` hook for injecting meta tags dynamically.
   - Enforce WCAG accessibility standards.
   - Fully responsive across all screen sizes.
   - Lazy-load non-critical assets (e.g., profile image).
   - Use error boundaries for critical components.

5. **Technology Stack:**
   - React 18+
   - TailwindCSS (dark mode enabled)
   - react-hook-form
   - react-helmet-async
   - react-toastify

Outcome: A fully responsive, dark-mode enabled, SEO-optimized, high-performance React application ready for public launch.
